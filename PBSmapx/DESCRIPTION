Description: PBSmapx (short-hand notation for PBS Map Explore), 
  provides a convenient Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool for 
  interacting with PBSmapping. The primary mapping function 
  `createMap` presents a menu system for plotting topographical 
  files as well as output from gridding and summary routines 
  for geo-referenced data such as catch, effort, and catch per 
  unit effort (CPUE).
