SQL Queries in PBSmapx
----------------------
The SQL query that appears in PBSmapx represents a small
subset of available SQL queries found in the package PBStools.
These queries are designed to work with DFO databases for 
people with appropriate credentials. Others may wish to use them
as templates to access their own databases.

Over time additional mapping queries from users and 
developers may be added here.

Alternatively, all queries in future may reside only in PBStools.
